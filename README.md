<h1 align="center">👋 Hi there! I'm Hari</h1>
I am B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering w/s AIML from SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur. Computers have held a life-long fascination for me. What started as an interest in just using them developed into a growing desire to understand how a collection of simple ideas and components can interact to produce an entity as complex and adaptable as a computer.<br>I am currently working on C++, Full Stack Development, AI & ML, MERN, Javascript and its frameworks. I am involved in a lot of organizational works in college related to clubs, hackathons and volunteered in many communities.
