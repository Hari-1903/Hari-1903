<h1 align="center">👋 Hi there! I'm Hari</h1>
Throughout my life, I have been deeply fascinated by computers, from their practical use to their complex inner workings. As an enthusiastic second-year student at SRMIST, Kattankulathur, I am committed to expanding my knowledge and skills in this ever-evolving field.
Initially, my curiosity was focused solely on their practical use, but it gradually evolved into a passionate pursuit of comprehending how a conglomeration of fundamental ideas and components can coalesce to give rise to a multifaceted and flexible entity such as a computer. As an enthusiast in web development and machine learning, my fervor for this field continues to flourish.
